I've been taking [Zell Liew's](https://zellwk.com/blog/) Build and Deploy workshop on the [Astro](https://astro.build/) Static Site Generator. _(Aside: this course was a great value as it was an 8-week live workshop with 1 hour instructional time, followed by an after-party which was open-discussion which, could range from 30 minutes to an hour)._ During the course, we started talking about showing what we had built with our newly acquired knowledge. That's when I decided to build this portfolio site and have at least a v1 available for review.

### I worked HARD to prepare

From start to v1, I had about a week to [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/uMRRCvFNkalcPhBOtRyqXX/Portfolio-v2.5?node-id=0%3A1), write content, [learn](https://astro.build/) and build. I wanted to have something that looked well-developed. I also didn't want to disappoint as in this class, we have an audience from around the world and some of my peers were up **very late**.

### Elements that were ready

Through the week, I worked on getting the following items done:

- Home page
  - Intro
  - Characteristics
  - Experience (GitHub projects)
  - Blog content
    - Show published blogs only
    - Show blogs by published date
    - Show 3 blogs on home screen
    - Individual blog pages
  - Outro
- Looks good on mobile and extra wide screens
- Header
- Footer

### I presented my site

The day came and after our final lesson, Zell handed over the reigns to me. I was ready for this. I presented my portfolio site to my peers. I showed them what I created in Figma. Then, showed them the home page and pointed out some of the technical aspects, such as the GitHub integration and pointing out other technical aspects.

### Everything was good

The comments in the chat were overwhelmingly good! Everybody had nice compliments about the design and functionality of my site. From the beginning, I've had a good experience with web developers. I've felt that our community is welcoming and this experience was no different. Everybody was very supportive of my presentation and I even received some valuable input:

```
Just a little feedback, aligning the cards so that the title, description, date, hyperlinks start and end at the same height would make it more clean.
```

Noted, now back to work ðŸ˜‰
