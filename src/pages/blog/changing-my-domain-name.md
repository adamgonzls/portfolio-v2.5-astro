### A-Damn-Good-Coder:

When I went through the process of rebuilding my portfolio, I wanted a punny and descriptive domain name. I fell in love with `adamgoodcoder.com`. Get it? **a-damn-good-coder**. I love it. People that I articulated it to love it, too. But, I had to change it...

### The problem: I can't read it to every person that encounters it

I think **a-damn-good-coder** is a great domain... _When pronounced like that._ The problem I've observed is that people read it as "adam-good-coder" which... sounds awkward.

### Finding a solution:

Prior to purchasing `adamgoodcoder.com`, I did a ton of brainstorming and informal surveys on potential domain names. This time I decided to ask ChatGPT for some recommendations:

1. CodedByAdam.com
2. AdamWebCrafts.com
3. FrontEndAdam.com
4. AdamInCode.com
5. CodeCraftsmanAdam.com
6. PixelPerfectAdam.com
7. DevAdamG.com
8. AdamDesignsWeb.com
9. ProCoderAdam.com
10. AdamHTML.com

### Introducing codedbyadam.com

Instead of spending a bunch of time debating and discussing which domain name is the best, I decided to just make a choice. Codedbyadam is descriptive, it's pronunciation isn't confusing, and it even saves me 2 characters over adamgoodcoder.
