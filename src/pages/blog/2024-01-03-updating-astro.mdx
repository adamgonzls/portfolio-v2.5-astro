### How it all started:

I decided that I wanted to have the date of my blog articles appear in the article (scroll up to see it in all it's glory). Once I displayed the date, I decided that I wanted it to appear in a specific format: **1st MonthAbbreviation Year**.

Luckily, I wrote a utility function that could do exactly that:

```js
export function readableDate(date) {
  return dateFns.format(new Date(date), 'do MMM yyyy')
}
```

The problem is that my blog articles are written in Markdown (.md) files and I can't use imports and exports in that file type. Hmmm how to import my function...

### Luckily Astro supports MDX in addition to Markdown

Looking through the Astro docs, I found that Astro supports MDX with the installation of the [MDX integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).

### Adding the integration seemed easy enough...

The [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) explain how to add the integration, and it seems simple enough: `npx astro add mdx`

### I needed to update Node and Astro

After typing the command in my terminal, I was prompted with an error: `Node.js v18.4.0 is not supported by Astro! Please upgrade Node.js to a supported version: ">=18.14.1"`

So, I updated Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)

### I'm not sure exactly when it happened but my Astro version got updated

I started using Astro before there was a version 1. When I checked my version of Astro after updating Node via NVM, I was on Astro version 4. I launched my dev environment and some of my images were't working but other than that everything seemed fairly intact.

For many of my images which I imported, I now need to use `variableName.src` in the src of `<img />` tags (it was simply `variableName` before).

### Conclusion

Overall, I'm glad I finally updated my version of Astro to something more current. I'm still trying to figure out how to get my Markdown and MDX files to recognize images in `src/images` but in the meantime, having blog images in `/public` is ok.

### Conclusion part 2

When I deployed my site to Netlify, the build failed, luckily [Netlify had some documentation for that, too](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/)
