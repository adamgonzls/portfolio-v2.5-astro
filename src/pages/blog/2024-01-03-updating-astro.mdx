### How it all started:

I decided that I wanted to have the date of my blog articles appear in the article (scroll up to see it in all it's glory). I wanted to do this because sometimes when I'm reading articles, when it was written can be important. Since I like to practice what I preach, I decided to implement this.
Adding the date to display in my Markdown (later MDX) was easy enough:

```js
<p class='articleCard__date'>{pubDate}</p>
```

Once I displayed the date, I decided that I wanted it to appear in a specific format: **Date MonthAbbreviation Year**.

Luckily, I previously wrote a utility function that could do exactly that:

```js
export function readableDate(date) {
  return dateFns.format(new Date(date), 'do MMM yyyy')
}
```

The problem is that my blog articles are written in Markdown (.md) files and I can't use imports and exports in that file type. Hmmm how to import my function...

### Luckily Astro supports MDX in addition to Markdown

Looking through the Astro docs, I found that Astro supports MDX with the installation of the [MDX integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).

### Adding the integration seemed easy enough...

The [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) explain how to add the integration, and it seems simple enough: `npx astro add mdx`

### I needed to update Node and Astro

After typing the command in my terminal, I was prompted with an error:

```
Node.js v18.4.0 is not supported by Astro! Please upgrade Node.js to a supported version: ">=18.14.1"
```

So, I updated Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)

### Astro was then updated

I started using Astro before there was a version 1. I checked my version of Astro after updating Node via NVM, I was on Astro version 4. I launched my dev environment and saw that some of my images were't working but other than that everything seemed fairly intact.

For many of my images which I imported, I now need to use `variableName.src` in the src of `<img />` tags (it was simply `variableName` before).

### Conclusion: I'm glad I updated Astro

Overall, I'm glad I finally updated my version of Astro to something more current. I'm still trying to figure out how to get my Markdown and MDX files to recognize images in `src/images` but in the meantime, having blog images in `/public` is ok.

### Conclusion part 2: An error deploying to Netlify

When I deployed my site to Netlify, the build failed with the following error:

```
Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2
```

I thought back to the fact that I updated Node on my local environment and thought a likely culprit was that perhaps I needed to update Node in the site configuration on Netlify. I checked the deploy log and found some evidence to support that theory:

```
Node.js v16.20.2 is not supported by Astro!
Please upgrade Node.js to supported version: ">=18.14.1"
```

What a clue right? Sure enough, I updated the Node.js dependency to 20.x, redeployed and got my site up and running again.
