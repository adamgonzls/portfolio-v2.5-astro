While I was working on a GitHub integration to feature some of my repos on my website, I found that I could use Topics (<a class="brand-link brand-link--callout" href="./2022-07-08-using-github-topics">I wrote about it</a>).

In the response, I was able to see all my repos and I could see a `topics` property:

```js
"topics": ["css","featured-repo","javascript-es6","json-api","localstorage","netlify","react","vite"],
```

I wasn't sure how to include `featured-repo` in my query.

I did some searching and I found an <a target="_blank" class="brand-link" href="https://fusebit.io/blog/github-search-api">article</a> that showed the basic search query syntax. In the article, the author gives an example:

```js
q=siddhant in:name type:user
```

That looks weird to me... So a quick google search later, I find that spaces can be used. Seeing the spaces created a mental block but, I'm glad to know that they are ok to use (although, I'll probably opt to use the &plus; symbol in the future).

Then, I referenced the GitHub docs and found that you can [search by topic](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories#search-by-topic). Using this information, I added `topic:featured-repo` to the query string.

```
// My functioning request URL initially looked like this:
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=adamgonzls in:name topic:featured-repo

// I later changed spaces to the + symbol:
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=adamgonzls+in:name+topic:featured-repo
```

I tested out my query in <a target="_blank" class="brand-link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client">Thunder Client</a> and success!

### Beautiful data returned

I now had an array of objects that had `topic:featured-repo` assigned to them.
