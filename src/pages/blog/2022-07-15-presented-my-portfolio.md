## {frontmatter.description}

I've been taking [Zell Liew's](https://zellwk.com/blog/) Build and Deploy workshop on the [Astro](https://astro.build/) Static Site Generator. During the course, we discussed showing what we had built with our newly acquired knowledge. I decided to build this portfolio site and have at least a v1 available for review.

### I worked hard to prepare

From start to v1, I had about a week to [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/uMRRCvFNkalcPhBOtRyqXX/Portfolio-v2.5?node-id=0%3A1), write content, learn and build. I wanted to have something that looked well-developed; I didn't want to disappoint as in this class, we have an audience from around the world and some of my peers were up **very late**.

### I presented my site

After our lesson, Zell handed over the reigns to me and I presented my portfolio site to my peers. I showed them what I created in Figma (another tool I recently started to take seriously). Then, showed them the home page and pointed out some of the technical aspects, such as the GitHub integration.

### Everything was good

From the beginning, I've had a good experience with web developers. I've felt that our community is welcoming and this experience was no different. Everybody was very supportive of my presentation and I received some valuable input:

```
Just a little feedback, aligning the cards so that the title, description, date, hyperlinks start and end at the same height would make it more clean.
```

Noted, now back to work ðŸ˜‰
