When I find things I like on the internet, I normally keep it open in a tab in Chrome for an undetermined amount of time from that moment on. This happens enough that I've decided to keep a running list of these items, this page is where they will go. I plan on adding various things that I like. They can be UI elements, icons, or heck, even class names that I like. The goal here is to have a library that I can refer to whenever I need inspiration.
