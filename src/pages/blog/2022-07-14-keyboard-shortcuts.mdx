While working on a layout for a blog page, I decided I should start making note of the different key commands that I use on a daily basis. This is a running list of keyboard shortcuts.

## VS Code

`⌘ command + w` - close current window

This has been a game changer - I now close tabs in VS Code when I'm done with them, instead of keeping them open indefinitely (now if only I could practice this in Chrome)

`shift + option + ↓` - duplicate current line down

`⌘ command + alt + ↓` - add another cursor below

`` ^ control + ` `` - open/close integrated terminal

`⌘ command + \` - split the terminal

This is great for when you need to view two files simultaneously in VS Code

`alt + click and drag file to destination` - duplicate file in VS Code

I did some searching and this was the best solution that didn't require a plug-in.

## Figma

`⌘ command + d` - duplicate current selection

`shift + i` - Show components menu

I use this one to access plugins such as Unsplash quickly.

`⌘ command + g` - group
