While working on a layout for a blog page, I decided I should start making note of the different key commands that I use on a daily basis. This is a running list of keyboard shortcuts that allow me to work more efficiently.

**Tip:** The `alt` key is referred to as the `option` key on a Mac.

## 🎨 Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Shortcuts

### open command palette

`⌘ command + shift + p`

### close current window

`⌘ command + w`

This has been a game changer - I now close tabs in VS Code when I'm done with them, instead of keeping them open indefinitely (now if only I could practice this in Chrome)

### duplicate current line down

`shift + ⌥ option + ↓`

### add another cursor below

`⌘ command + ⌥ option + ↓`

### open/close integrated terminal

`` ^ control + ` ``

### split the terminal

`⌘ command + \`

This is great for when you need to view two files simultaneously in VS Code

### duplicate file in VS Code

`⌥ option + click and drag file to destination`

I did some searching and this was the best solution that didn't require a plug-in.

## 🍎 Mac Shortcuts

### Fast application switching

`⌘ command + tab`

## 💡 Figma

### Duplicate current selection

`⌘ command + d`

### Show components menu

`shift + i`

I use this one to access plugins such as Unsplash quickly.

### Group selection

`⌘ command + g`

## ✈️ Tailwind CSS

### Text shadow

```html
<h2
  class="mt-8 lg:mt-0 mb-0 text-center font-normal text-3xl lg:text-[44px] lg:text-white -tracking-[.6px] lg:-tracking-[0.88px] leading-normal lg:leading-normal lg:[text-shadow:_0_4px_4px_rgba(0_0_0_/_0.25)]"

```

### Inline ternary operator

```js
<div
  class={`relative rounded-xl pt-3.5 md:pt-7 px-5 pb-[10px] md:pb-[22px] bg-neutral ${
    index === 0 ? "rounded-bl-none rounded-br-none" : ""
  }`}
></div>
```

### Background image

```html
<div
  class="h-[218px] lg:h-[234px] lg:rounded-3xl bg-dark bg-[url('../images/blogSubmission/laptop-medium-shot-923w.png')] bg-no-repeat bg-center bg-cover"
></div>
```
