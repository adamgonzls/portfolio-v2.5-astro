While working on a layout for a blog page, I decided I should start making note of the different key commands that I use on a daily basis. This is a running list of keyboard shortcuts that allow me to work more efficiently.

**Tip:** The `alt` key is referred to as the `option` key on a Mac.

## 🎨 Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Shortcuts

### open command palette

`⌘ command + shift + p`

### close current window

`⌘ command + w`

This has been a game changer - I now close tabs in VS Code when I'm done with them, instead of keeping them open indefinitely (now if only I could practice this in Chrome)

### duplicate current line down

`shift + ⌥ option + ↓`

### add another cursor below

`⌘ command + ⌥ option + ↓`

### open/close integrated terminal

`` ^ control + ` ``

### split the terminal

`⌘ command + \`

This is great for when you need to view two files simultaneously in VS Code

### duplicate file in VS Code

`⌥ option + click and drag file to destination`

I did some searching and this was the best solution that didn't require a plug-in.

## 🍎 Mac Shortcuts

### Fast application switching

`⌘ command + tab`

## 💡 Figma

### Duplicate current selection

`⌘ command + d`

### Show components menu

`shift + i`

I use this one to access plugins such as Unsplash quickly.

### Group selection

`⌘ command + g`
