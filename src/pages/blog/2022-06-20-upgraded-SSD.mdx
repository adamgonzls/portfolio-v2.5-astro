Recently, my MacBook Pro had been complaining about low disk space... And it was running S-L-O-W. I had to do something. Knowing that upgrading RAM without a soldering iron was impossible, I figured clearing out my hard disk drive was the next best thing.

After spending hours clearing out my HDD of as much "stuff" as I could (even deleting many node_modules folders), I had a whopping 16GB of disk space available out of 120GB; my computer couldn't even manage the latest Xcode update.

I needed more storage space and after some searching, I found [OWC](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ssd/owc/macbook/2006-current) had some great MacBook Pro upgrade kits.

I ended up slapping the new SSD in there and my daily dev life is so much better. I strongly recommend this upgrade for anyone trying to eke out more life out of their MBP.
