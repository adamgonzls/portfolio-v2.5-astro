While working on a layout for a blog page, I decided I should start making note of the different key commands that use on a daily (or not so daily) basis.

## VS Code

`shift + option + ↓` - duplicate current line down

## figma

`⌘ command + d` - duplicate current selection

`shift + i` - resources (use this to access plugins quickly)

`⌘ command + g` - group
