### I decided to up my Regex game

Recently, a [fellow developer](https://thedudeway.com/) challenged me on [codewars](https://codewars.com). I hadn't spent time there in a while and he recommended I get back on there and do some algorithm challenges.

I'll be honest, spending hours on end doing random algorithm challenges wasn't too appealing to me.

### The situation

```js
function solution(string) {
  const regex = /[A-Z]/g
  return string
    .split('')
    .map((letter) => (letter.match(regex) ? ` ${letter}` : letter))
    .join('')
}
```

The part that I was proudest in the example above was that I wrote the regex constant from memory.

### A finishing touch worth pursuing

As I was updating my signature with my new web site, I wasn't so fond of having @gmail for my contact email. Making this change so I can have both with the same domain really brought a smile to my face. Crazy how something that could seem so insignificant could make such an impact.
