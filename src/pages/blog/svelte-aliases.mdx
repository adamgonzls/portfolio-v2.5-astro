## While working on my Svelte project, I found myself drowning in ../../../ import paths.

Traversing one or two directories isn't so bad on smaller projects but when you start refactoring and moving files around, it can get messy.

```javascript
// Going from this:
import SomeComponent from "../../SomeComponent.svelte"

// To this:
import SomeComponent from "../../components/SomeComponent.svelte"
```

## I wanted to clean up my import paths by setting up aliases to make my code more readable and maintainable.

After doing some refactoring and reorganization and getting tired (and confused) of the endless dots, I decided to set up aliases in my SvelteKit project.

## I updated the svelte.config.js

Checkout the `alias` property in the `kit` object:

```javascript
import adapter from "@sveltejs/adapter-netlify"
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte"

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  // Consult https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/integrations#preprocessors
  // for more information about preprocessors
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),

  kit: {
    // adapter-auto only supports some environments, see https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto for a list.
    // If your environment is not supported or you settled on a specific environment, switch out the adapter.
    // See https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters for more information about adapters.
    adapter: adapter(),
    alias: {
      $components: "src/components",
    },
  },
}

export default config
```

The magic happens in the line I set my alias to `$components` and pointed it to the `src/components` directory.

## With aliases, my import paths are cleaner and easier to read. No more endless dots to navigate folders!

Now I can import components like this:

```javascript
import SomeComponent from "$components/SomeComponent.svelte"
```

That's it! This has made my project easier to maintain and read, especially after moving things around. One of the best things about using aliases is that if I move the file importing and using the component (that was imported using the alias), I don't need to update the import because that stays the same!

### Key Takeaways

- **Updating the config file:** This only takes a few minutes to do.
- **Updating existing imports** The syntax is straight forward and easy to implement.
